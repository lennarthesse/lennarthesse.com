                        <h2>Terminal based text-adventure game in Java</h2>
                        <small>September 21, 1978</small>
                        <p>In this article I want to show the process of how I built my own little text-adventure game. My motivation was to gain more experience in coding besides the tasks that I work on for university that are also why I have been using Java alot for the last year. Because of that, I decided to build the game using Java.</p>
                        
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>I wanted a simple approach where I don't have to worry about getting to know the entire environment beforehand like with Unity3D. So instead of building a complete UI, I simply print the output to the console. That way you can just execute the .jar and let it run in the terminal, which is already the exact feel I wanted to achieve for this game.</p>
