                        <h2>Creating a Personal Website (Part 2/2): The Web Server</h2>
                        <small>August 10, 2022</small>
                    </div>
                    <p>In the first part of this series, we built our own website. Now we want to actually put it on the internet in a professional but still affordable way. This will allow you to have a professional online appearance beyond just having a website.</p>
                    
                    <div class="panel">
                        <h3>Serving to The Web</h3>
                        <p>In order to serve a website to the world wide web, we need a so-called web server. It consists of a hardware and a software part, where the hardware can basically be any computer that is connected to the internet. For the software, we have several options like Apache or Nginx.</p>
                        <p>For this article I will be using Apache2. However, the setup for Nginx won't be much different. Additionally, I will use Ubuntu as the operating system.</p>
                
                        <h3>Installing Apache</h3>
                        <p>In Ubuntu, the installation is as simple as using the built-in package manager to download and install Apache. Note that we are using the root user and thus have all privileges. Otherwise, you will need to add <code class="lang-">sudo</code> in front of the commands.</p>
                
                        <pre><code class="lang-">root@localhost:~# apt install apache2</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
                
                        <p>Now everything should be set up and the web server should be running. To check, we can print out the contents of Apaches's configuration folder by typing <code class="lang-">ls /etc/apache2/</code>, which should look like this:</p>
                
                        <pre><code class="lang-">root@localhost:~# ls /etc/apache2/
apache2.conf    magic           sites-available
conf-available  mods-available  sites-enabled
conf-enabled    mods-enabled
envvars         ports.conf</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
                
                        <p>We can also request the status with <code class="lang-">systemctl</code>. If the server is running, the output should look like the following. The relevant thing here is that it says <code class="lang-">Active: active (running)</code>.</p>
                
                        <pre><code class="lang-">root@localhost:~# systemctl status apache2.service

                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
                
                        <p>If it says <code class="lang-">inactive</code> or <code class="lang-">failed</code>, you can try to restart the server by using <code class="lang-">systemctl restart apache2.service</code>.</p>
                
                        <h3>Uploading The Website</h3>
                        <p>If we now type the IP address of the computer running Apache (you can find it by typing <code class="lang-">hostname -I</code> in the terminal) into our browser, we will see Apache's default page. </p>
                
                        <a href="./articles/website/apache.png" target="_blank"><img src="./articles/website/apache.png" alt="Apache's default page"></a>
                
                        <p>It gives some useful information about the structure of the configuration folder and, crucially for our next step, where the document root for our website's files is situated, being <code class="lang-">/var/www/</code>. Here we can already create a folder for our website and copy all files into it.</p>
                        <p>Now we have to configure Apache to serve our website instead of the default page. Inside of the configuration folder <code class="lang-">/etc/apache2/</code> we change into the <code class="lang-">sites-available/</code> folder and copy the <code class="lang-">000-default.conf</code> file to a file with some name, e.g. our domain name, keeping the ending <code class="lang-">.conf</code>.</p>
                
                        <p>Here we change/uncomment the following directives, replacing the [information] with our actual details.</p>
                
                        <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin [contact email address]
    ServerName [domain name]
    ServerAlias www.[domain name]
    DocumentRoot /var/www/[website folder]
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
                
                        <p>Both <code class="lang-">ServerName</code> and <code class="lang-">ServerAlias</code> are relevant if you have bought a domain, which I will talk about in a moment, and should be left out if there is no domain associated with the IP address.</p>
                
                        <p>We now enable our website's configuration, disable the default one, and restart the server with these three commands:</p>
                
                        <pre><code class="lang-">root@localhost:~# a2ensite [name].conf
root@localhost:~# a2dissite 000-default.conf
root@localhost:~# systemctl restart apache2.service</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
                
                        <p>Now we have our website showing up.</p>
                
                        <h3>Intermezzo</h3>
                        <p>Up to this point, you could use your personal computer connected to your local network to serve your website. And it would be sufficient if you only wanted you and your family or roommates to see it.</p>
                        <p>To make it accessible for everyone connected to the internet, however, you would need to configure your router in a way to let outside traffic pass through. Furthermore, you would have to contact your internet provider and ask them for a static IP address since the address of your router that is actually connected to the internet can change.</p>
                        <p>While there are workarounds to obtain an effectively static IP address by constantly updating the address associated with the domain in the DNS record, I decided against this option. Simply renting a server will provide you with a static IP address, take care of making the server accessible from the outside, and often come with a professional email address and SSL certificate which allows traffic through the encrypted HTTPS protocol.</p>
                
                        <h3>Renting a Server</h3>
                        <p>At first, I was disappointed since all the hosting solutions I could find cost more than I was willing to spend. But after a little bit more research, I found that beside managed hosting, you can rent so-called root servers that simply provide a (virtual) machine running an operating system, leaving setup and configuration of the server to you, but costing significantly less.</p>
                        <p>So I went ahead and rented the smallest virtual private server at IONOS for 2€ a month and also bought a domain. To then set up Apache, we follow the steps I described above, connecting to the server through SSH.</p>
                        <p>To connect the domain to the IP address of our server, we add the domain and address to the DNS record through the server provider's control panel. Now we can actually add the <code class="lang-">ServerName</code> and <code class="lang-">ServerAlias</code> directives to our site's configuration and restart Apache for the changes to take effect. The server should now be accessible through our domain name.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Adding SSL</h3>
                        <p>Now we want to allow traffic to use the encrypted HTTPS instead of HTTP. To enable HTTPS, we need an SSL certificate, which in my case was included in the root server package. First, we enable Apache's SSL module:</p>
                
                        <pre><code class="lang-">root@localhost:~# a2enmod ssl</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
                
                        <p>Then we edit our website's configuration to support HTTPS traffic through port 443 and redirect any HTTP requests to HTTPS:</p>
                
                        <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin [contact email address]
    ServerName [domain name]
    ServerAlias www.[domain name]
    DocumentRoot /var/www/[website folder]
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    Redirect permanent / https://[domain name]
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin [contact email address]
    ServerName [domain name]
    ServerAlias www.[domain name]
    DocumentRoot /var/www/[website folder]
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile      /path/to/certificate.cer
    SSLCertificateKeyFile   /path/to/private-key.key
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
                
                        <p>When setting up your SSL certificate through the provider, you will get access to a certificate and a private key file, which need to be linked with the <code class="lang-">SSLCertificateFile</code> and <code class="lang-">SSLCertificateKeyFile</code> directives.</p>
                
                        <p>Finally, we will configure a firewall to allow both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Using UFW, you can see the status of the firewall by typing <code class="lang-">ufw status</code> and available profiles by typing <code class="lang-">ufw app list</code>. Upon installation, Apache creates preset profiles, so the output should look like this:</p>
                        
                        <pre><code class="lang-">root@localhost:~# ufw app list
Available applications:
    Apache
    Apache Full
    Apache Secure
    OpenSSH</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
                            
                        <p>First, in order to ensure that we will still be able to connect to our server, we allow SSH traffic with <code class="lang-">ufw allow OpenSSH</code>. Then, we allow the profile <code class="lang-">Apache Full</code> which opens ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS traffic. We then enable the firewall and check the status. The result should look like this:</p>
                
                        <pre><code class="lang-">root@localhost:~# ufw enable
root@localhost:~# ufw status
Status: active

To                  Action      From
--                  ------      ----
OpenSSH             ALLOW       Anywhere                  
Apache Full         ALLOW       Anywhere                  
OpenSSH (v6)        ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
Apache Full (v6)    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
                
                        <p>And that's it already! We have set up our webserver and enabled SSL to allow a secure connection to our website.</p>
                
                        <h3>Where to Go From Here</h3>
                        <p>What I have shown here is still only a small part of what you can do. For example, it could be a good idea to use PHP to create more server-side interaction like loading data from a database, creating forms, or uploading files. Or you could dive deeper into JavaScript and add more fancy animations or host you own web app.</p>
                        <p>Still, a static website like the one we built is a good starting point for your online presence. Also, being able to have your own personalized email address helps you appear more professional and will definitely leave an impression on employers and other people researching you.</p>

                    <p> This is exactly what I thought to myself just a few weeks ago. The answer is simple: build your own platform, independent and exactly fitted to your needs.</p>
                    
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>In this article series, I want to show the steps it took me to develop and afterwards host my own website, giving a rough outline of the entire process. You can take a look at the full source code on <a href="https://www.github.com/lennarthesse/lennarthesse.com" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
    
                        <h3>What We Will Need</h3>
                        <p>The basic components of a website are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, if you want your website to be publicly available on the internet, you will need a web server to serve your page to visitors. For now, we will concentrate on building the website, leaving the setup of the webserver for part two.</p>
    
                        <h3>HTML - The Basic Structure</h3>
                        <p>HTML can be thought of as the backbone of a website. It structures the different parts and provides elements for CSS and JavaScript to attach to.</p>
                        <p>For my website, I wanted to have a large header filling the entire screen when you first visit the site. I also liked the idea of having everything on one site, not using any subsites, with a feed of all articles and a sidebar with additional information.</p>
                        <p>This left me with a basic outline of the HTML document's structure like this:</p>

                        <pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;main&gt;
            &lt;article&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
        &lt;/main&gt;
        &lt;aside&gt;
            &lt;div class="card"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/aside&gt;
        &lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>

                        <p>Next, it was time to prepare the individual elements for styling with CSS. For the header and the cards of the sidebar I basically just used regular headings and paragraphs. The articles, however, needed a more complex structure. I ended up adding an image, followed by a container with an <code class="lang-html">article-head</code> class for the title and date of the article, which will be styled differently.</p>

                        <pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;article&gt;
    &lt;img src="./path/to/image" alt="description"&gt;
    &lt;div class="article-head"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Title&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;Date&lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Article content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>
    
                        <h3>CSS - The Looks</h3>
                        <p>If you take a look at the website so far, you probably won't be convinced to let *that* be your online presence. This is where CSS comes in. It is used to style elements' attributes according to certain rules and will take our website from looking something like this:</p>
                        <a href="./articles/website/before.png" target="_blank"><img src="./articles/website/before.png" alt="Website without CSS"></a>
                        <p>...to looking more like this:</p>
                        <a href="./articles/website/after.png" target="_blank"><img src="./articles/website/after.png" alt="Website with CSS"></a>
                        <p>The first thing I did was to style the header. Since I wanted it to take up the entire screen, I set its <code class="lang-css">height</code> to <code class="lang-css">100vh</code>, which means 100% of the vertical height of the viewport, the viewport being the part of the website that is currently visible.</p>
                        <p>For a complete reference of CSS units, HTML tags, and more I highly recommend <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>; it is where i got most of my information from and it provides interactive examples for basically everything.</p>
                        <p>After that, I set the background color, text color, and font size. To then center the text <i>vertically</i>, there are multiple solutions: the newer flexbox, and position/transform. I used the combination of position and transform, since flexbox only works on newer versions of browsers.</p>

                        <pre><code class="lang-css">header {
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: #99ccdd;
}

header .container {
    color: white;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translate(0%, -50%);
}

header h1 {
    font-size: 4.5em;
}</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>

                        <p>I proceeded in a similar fashion with the other elements. To display the main content next to the sidebar, the <code class="lang-css">float</code> property can be used. This, however, can create complications with elements occluding each other. To fix this, the so-called "clearfix" hack can be used.</p>
                        <p>After a little bit more touching up, adjusting margins and paddings, and adding stylistic elements like borders, the bulk of the work is already done. Now we can move on to what brings our website from the ordinary to the exceptional.</p>

                        <h3>JavaScript - Interaction, Animation, and More</h3>
                        <p>Up to this point, our website is pretty static and doesn't do much. To add functionality when we press a button or create pop-ups and animations, we need JavaScript, the first real programming language in our trio.</p>
                        <p>In my case, I had to add a "Read More" button to the articles that would then expand the article, since I wanted to have everything on the main page. Firstly, I added a <code class="lang-html">&lt;button&gt;</code> element to the HTML document:</p>
                        
                        <pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div class="center-wrapper"&gt;
    &lt;button class="centered colored-button"&gt;
        Read More
    &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>

                        <p>I then styled it in CSS, centering it and adjusting a few attributes:</p>

                        <pre><code class="lang-css">.center-wrapper {
    position: relative;
}

.centered {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

.colored-button {
    cursor: pointer;
    background-color: #4682b4;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
    padding: 0.5em 1em;
}</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>

                        <p>Now, to add a function to the button, we can use its onclick event by writing <code class="lang-html">&lt;button onclick="our-javascript"&gt;</code>. This will execute the JavaScript code inside the quotes. And while we could write it directly in there, it is better to call an earlier defined function that sits in a dedicated JavaScript file.</p>
                        <p>The function for my button looks like this:</p>

                        <pre><code class="lang-js">function readMore(btn) {
    var parent = btn.parentElement.parentElement;
    var panel = parent.querySelector(".panel");

    if (panel.style.maxHeight == "0px") {
        panel.style.maxHeight = panel.scrollHeight + "px";
        btn.innerHTML = "Read Less";
    } else {
        panel.style.maxHeight = "0px";
        btn.innerHTML = "Read More";
    }                        
}</code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>

                        <p>Upon call, the button passes itself to the function so that a variable of its parent, or rather grandparent, can be initialized. That element is actually the article that contains the button. This way, the function only targets the article whose "Read More" button has been pressed.</p>
                        <p>Then we check whether the article is collapsed, which is realized through a panel, containing the rest of the article, having a height of 0. If this is the case at the time the button is pressed, the panel is expanded to fit its content and the button's text is adjusted to "Read Less".</p>
                        <p>If the panel already is expanded, the function notices that the button is now a "Read Less" button and accordingly collapses the panel.</p>

                        <h4>Animation</h4>
                        <p>Animating an element is quite simple, too. At the bottom of the header, I wanted to have a hint that shows that there is more content waiting below. Again, I first added an HTML element, this time containing an icon, styled it, and then created a function in my JavaScript file.</p>
                        <p>The basic idea of an animation is to change an element's position by a small amount for every small timestep. Moving a positioned element can be done by changing one or more of the defining attributes <code class="lang-css">top</code>, <code class="lang-css">bottom</code>, <code class="lang-css">left</code>, and <code class="lang-css">right</code>.</p>
                        <p>Moving up or down can be realized by adding or subtracting from the <code class="lang-css">bottom</code> attribute. I added a boolean variable <code class="lang-css">up</code>, that changes at specified thresholds, and adjusted the position accordingly.</p>

                        <pre><code class="lang-js">function animateHint() {
    if (xPos == 10) {
        up = false;
    } else if (xPos == 0) {
        up = true;
    }
    if (up) {
        xPos++;
    } else if (!up) {
        xPos--;
    }
    downIcon.style.bottom = xPos + "px";
}
                        </code></pre>
                        <div class="credit">
                            <small class="credit"><a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Prism</a></small>
                        </div>

                        <p>This function is then called at a specified interval with <code class="lang-js">setInterval(animateHint, 75);</code>.</p>

                        <h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
                        <p>Having the basics laid down, it is only a matter of expanding on it. For example, I went on to add a different styling for small screens, where the sidebar is displayed underneath the articles, and a pop-up menu to navigate there. Also, I added more buttons and a search bar to look for specific articles.</p>
                        <p>The next step is to actually host our website on a server, which I will talk about in part two of this series.</p>

                </article>
